# Student Course Management System

A full-stack web application built using **Java Spring Boot Microservices**, **PostgreSQL**, and an **Angular frontend**, simulating a modern learning platform. Students can register/login, enroll/search courses, submit assignments, and view grades. Instructors manage course content and track student progress. The system features secure role-based access, modular microservice architecture, and scalable deployment on the cloud.

## Microservices Overview

- **User Service** â€“ Handles registration, login, and role assignment  
- **Course Service** â€“ Manages course data (CRUD operations, search)  
- **Enrollment Service** â€“ Handles student course enrollments and history  
- **Progress Service** â€“ Tracks lesson/module completion and generates reports  
- *(Optional)* **Recommendation Service** â€“ Suggests courses based on interests

## Future Improvements

- OAuth2 support and enhanced security
- Redis caching and performance optimization
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions or Jenkins
- Kubernetes deployment for orchestration
- UI/UX improvements and full mobile responsiveness
